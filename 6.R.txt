1)Break statement

A break statement is used inside a loop (repeat, for, while) to stop the iterations and flow the control outside of the loop.

In a nested looping situation, where there is a loop inside another loop, this statement exits from the innermost loop that is being evaluated.

the break statement can also be used inside the  else branch of if...else statement.

syntax:

if (test_expression) {
break
}

example:

x <- LETTERS[1:10]
for (val in x) {
if (val == 'F'){
break
}
print(val)
}


2)Next statement

A next statement is useful when we want to skip the current iteration of a loop without terminating it. On encountering next, the R parser skips further evaluation and starts next iteration of the loop.

the break statement can also be used inside the  else branch of if...else statement.

syntax:

if (test_condition) {
next
}

example:


x <- LETTERS[1:10]
for (val in x) {
if (val == 'F'){
next
}
print(val)
}
